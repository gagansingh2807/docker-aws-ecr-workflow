Docker AWS ECR Workflow

This repository contains a sample application that demonstrates how to automatically build Docker images and upload them to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) using GitHub Actions upon code pushes or pull requests.

Overview
The project includes a simple "Hello World" application, a Dockerfile to containerize this application, and a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the process of building this Docker image and pushing it to AWS ECR.

Repository Structure
index.js: A simple Node.js application that prints "Hello, World!" (or your chosen language equivalent).
Dockerfile: Defines how the Docker image for the application is built.
.github/workflows/docker-build.yml: The GitHub Actions workflow that automates the build and push process.

Prerequisites
An AWS account with access to ECR
A GitHub account
Basic knowledge of Docker and GitHub Actions

Setup
1. AWS ECR Setup
Create an ECR repository in your AWS account.
Configure the necessary IAM roles and policies to allow access to the ECR repository.
2. GitHub Repository Setup
Fork or clone this repository.
Add your application code (e.g., index.js).
Ensure the Dockerfile is configured for your application.
3. GitHub Actions Workflow
The .github/workflows/docker-build.yml file is already set up to trigger on push or pull requests.
Add your AWS credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) to your GitHub repository's secrets.

Running the Workflow
The workflow will trigger automatically on a push or a pull request to the main branch.
It will build the Docker image and push it to the specified ECR repository.

Security and Best Practices
Ensure that your AWS credentials are stored securely as GitHub secrets.
Regularly update dependencies and base images in your Dockerfile to mitigate vulnerabilities.
